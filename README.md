# Woocommerce Custobar

This WordPress plugin is used to send statistics from the WooCommerce plugin to the Custobar API.

Synchronization is provided by updates of 3 data types that include sales, customers and products. This is done by asynchronous API calls (utilizing scheduled events) after the relevant create or update action has been triggered. No data is removed or synced backwards from Custobar by this plugin nor does the API provide such functionality.

Relevant WooCommerce data has been mapped to the data fields offered by Custobar. Mapped data goes through WordPress filters so it's possible for site developers to add custom fields to the data before it gets sent to the Custobar API.

This plugin uses create and update hooks of WooCommerce's CRUD commands which were introduced in version 3.0, so no support for previous versions is provided.

Plugin code has been written following the PSR-2 coding standard.
